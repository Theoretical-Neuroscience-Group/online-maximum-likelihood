# Online Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Parameters of Partially Observed Diffusion Processes

This is the code to reproduce the figures from [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8528340).
To run the code, you need to install Julia, instantiate the project, and run the following scripts.

## Figure 1
Running `make_figure1.jl` will produce figure 1:

## Figure 2
Running `make_figure2.jl` will produce figure 2:

## Figure 3
> [!NOTE]  
> The code for reproducing this figure is broken and currently not included in this repo.

## Figure 4
Running `make_figure4.jl` will produce figure 4:
